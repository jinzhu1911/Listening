I want to talk to today about creative confidence.
I'm going to start way back in the third grade at school in .
I remember one day my best friend Brain was working on a project.
He was making a horse out of the clay that our teacher kept under the sink.
And at one point, one of the girls who was sitting at his table, seeing what he was doing,
leaned over and said to him, 
That's terrible. That doesn't look anything like a horse.
And Brain's shoulders sank. 
And he wadded up the clay of horse and he threw it back in the bin.
I can't never saw  Brain do a project like that ever again. 
And I wonder how often that happens.
It seems like when I told that story of Brain to my class, a lot of them want to come up after class 
tell me about the similar experience how teatcher shut them down or how student was particularly cruel to them.
And some opt out thinking of themselves as creative at that point.
And I see that opting out that happens in childhood, and it moves in and becomes more ingrained 
even by the time you get to adult life.
So, we see a lot of this. 
When we have a workshop, or when we have clients in to work with us side-by-side,
eventually we get to the point in the process that's fuzzy or unconventional.

conventional important a phone call
we know that's not true
important 
so comfortable going on
we know that's not true
amazing things it's surprise really are
judgement we have 
you don't use things you afraid about

It's really enjoyable 
It's really intresting
I'm not going there  
It take people  to in the room

everything is fine 
Something else happen
