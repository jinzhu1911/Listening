I want to talk to today about creative confidence.
I'm going to start way back in the third grade at school in .
I remember one day my best friend Brain was working on a project.
He was making a horse out of the clay that our teacher kept under the sink.
And at one point, one of the girls who was sitting at his table, seeing what he was doing,
leaned over and said to him



One point one girl sit in his table 
That's terrible like a holes  throw back
I can't never again 
to my class
project like that ever again
to my class a lot told some kind
how teatcher shout them down

so, we see a lot of this when we have a side by side
conventional important a phone call
we know that's not true
important 
so comfortable going on
we know that's not true
amazing things it's surprise really are
judgement we have 
you don't use things you afraid about
judge lovely guy in four hours
we talk about snakes fear snakes
It's really enjoyable 
It's really intresting
I'm not going there  
It take people  to in the room
with door open in the room touch the snake 
everything is fine 
Something else happen  
This people touch snake 
they try hard face 
new confidence
 
they can change the world set up to do
famous science something 
they go to the process
walk around to me
