The first reason is that we not familiar with some techniques
that are widely used in American English.
For example, there's flap sound, contractions, and there's linking,etc.
Those are all things that's very common in American English.
For example, listen to this sentence: 
I got a flat tire yesterday and it cost me about 300 dollars to fix it. 
The way I was saying it, I used a couple of contractions and, linking,
and for us, we're just not familiar with us. 
So now, let's talk about some solutions.
One soulution is that you can totally do this on your own.
I think 10 seasons of Freinds or 9 seasons or 10 seasons of HIMYM is totoally 
enough for you to organise all the techniques you'll ever gonna need to speak 
American English.
So basically what you're doing is organising or come up with your own personal grammer book basically 
that's suitable for you.
